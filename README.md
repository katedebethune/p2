1. Wordlist was pulled from the bash copy of Webster's Dictionary <br />
found at /usr/share/dict/words. I selected all of the four letter words <br />
in the dictionary using the command
grep '^[a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z]$'

This produced a list of 4347 words 

grep '^[a-z][a-z][a-z][a-z]$' words | wc -l
